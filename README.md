# TypeCast: Fishing Typing Game

**Authors:** Petie Deveer, Adrian Burke

## Overview

TypeCast, a text-based console game, blends the thrill of fishing with typing challenges. Players embark on virtual fishing expeditions, using their typing skills to catch a diverse range of fish species. This edition of TypeCast emphasizes efficient programming and optimized performance, bringing a smoother and more responsive gaming experience.

In TypeCast, each cast tests your typing speed and accuracy. Fish appear with a ticking clock; type their names swiftly to make the catch. Post-catch, a detailed summary showcases your success. Choose to continue with new gear or take a moment to admire your collection.

## Optimization and Low-Level Implementation

Optimization is at the heart of TypeCast. We've delved into machine code operations and assembly language principles to fine-tune our C++ data structures, ensuring peak efficiency and performance.

### Key Optimization Aspects:

1. **Memory Management:** Leveraging low-level understanding, we've optimized memory usage, ensuring lightweight and fast data structures.
2. **Inline Function Implementation:** Critical functions, such as random number generation, are inlined for minimal overhead, directly inspired by assembly-level efficiency.
3. **Real-Time Input Handling:** Assembly language insights have guided the development of responsive and precise input systems, crucial for the timed typing challenges.
4. **Optimized Timing Mechanisms:** Precision in timing is achieved by integrating high-accuracy libraries, ensuring fairness and challenge in gameplay.

## Tools and Technologies

Our optimized TypeCast version is built using:

- **C++ with Assembly Insights**: For creating efficient and responsive game mechanics.
- **GitHub**: Collaborative development and version control.
- **Visual Studio**: Our hub for coding, debugging, and compiling the optimized game.

## Purpose

Our dual objectives in redeveloping TypeCast are:

1. Harness low-level programming concepts to enhance data structure efficiency in C++.
2. Implement high-precision timed events, mirroring real-world gaming scenarios.
3. Spread the excitement of fishing in a novel format, now with a heightened focus on performance.

## Current Status

üîß **Bug Notice:** We're addressing a specific bug related to re-casting after catching a Mahi Mahi.
