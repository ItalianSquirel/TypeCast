# TypeCast: Fishing Typing Game

**Authors:** Petie Deveer, Adrian Burke

## Overview

TypeCast is a text-based console game that brings the excitement of fishing to your computer screen. In this game, players will embark on a fishing adventure, armed with their choice of fishing rod and bait. The objective is to attract, hook, and catch various fish species through timed typing challenges.

TypeCast is designed to challenge players' typing skills while providing an entertaining and immersive fishing experience. Each cast of the virtual fishing line presents a unique fish to be caught. Players must type the fish's name within a limited time frame to successfully hook it. After a successful catch, players receive a summary of the fish they've caught and can choose to cast again or change their equipment for the next attempt.

## Implementation

TypeCast is implemented in C++ to create a real-time, text-based gaming experience. It is not hosted on netrun as real-time input is required, and netrun may not be suitable for this purpose.

To achieve a seamless gaming experience, we aim to create flexible and optimized data structures. This is a challenge for us as we are more accustomed to higher-level languages with less emphasis on efficiency. We may even explore assembly language to include precompiled tables of probabilities to avoid runtime calculations.

The element of timing adds another layer of complexity. Different methods and libraries for measuring time have varying levels of accuracy and performance. We will carefully address these challenges to ensure accurate timed events in the game.

## Tools

We will be using the following tools and technologies for the development of TypeCast:

- **C++**: The primary programming language for game development.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaborative development.
- **Visual Studio**: For coding, debugging, and building the game.

## Purpose

Our main goals for creating TypeCast are:

1. Apply our understanding of machine code operations to create more efficient data structures in C++.
2. Accurately implement timed events in a gaming context.
3. Share our passion for fishing with a wider audience, introducing the thrill of fishing in a unique and challenging format.

We are excited to take on this project, and we hope you enjoy playing TypeCast as much as we enjoy creating it!

## Bug Notice
Important: There is a known bug when typing "yes" to cast again after reeling in a Mahi Mahi fish. We're working to resolve this issue.
